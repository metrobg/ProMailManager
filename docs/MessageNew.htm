      </strong><strong>1. </strong>If you are using Internet Explorer 5 or above
      on Windows then your screen will look like the screen shot above, to further
      enhance your usability of this feature you can resize the editor viewable
      area by using the pop-up selections in this menu and click the &quot;Resize
      Editor&quot; button. This button will also cause the editor to be active
      or inactive based on the state of the editor status button.<strong><br>
       <font color="Red">* Note</font> we have added the ability to disable the
       WYSIWYG editor</strong>, it may at first sight seem strange to offer this
       capability. Without going into too much detail, the editor uses the built
       in capabilities<strong> </strong>of Windows and Internet Explorer which
       inherently creates one main problem when dealing with importing of entire
       web pages or pasting in fully formatted web pages in that Internet Explorer
       will remove opening and closing HTML and in most cases BODY tags. The
       reason for this is that Internet Explorer is essentially displaying this
       content in editable format in an iframe which essentially has its own
       opening and closing HTML/BODY tags, Internet explorer recognizes a potential
       display issue in your page also having opening and closing tags so it
       &quot;kindly&quot; removes them for you. This is not a feature or restriction of
       our application is is merely the tradeoff received by utilizing the handy
       features of using an in-browser editor. How to get around this problem?
       the only reliable way it to disable the editor and import your web page
       in which will then be imported and give you the capability of storing
       it in its original form, thus preserving style sheet references and other
       important header elements.<strong><br>

  If you have a web page already created that you would like to import directly
  into your message, use the box to the left, to import your web page into your

  a full web page (suggested to maintain original content)
