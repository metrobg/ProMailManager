        arbitrary name you give to your list, purely for recording and reference
        purposes, this is not displayed when your emails are sent from this List.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2. Administrator Group</strong> - This is very important as this
      is where you assign ownership (log in / administration rights) to this
      list. So as the administrator (only Administrator can create Administrator
      Groups) you first go to the Administrator Groups screen and create a new
      Group for this List, then return here and the list will be available in
      the Administrator Group select menu to assign ownership of this list to<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3. Email List From E-Mail Address</strong> - This is the email
      address that all messages broadcast from this list will appear to come
      from (depending on the security measures set up on your mail server you
      may have to ensure that this address has relay access to the mail server
      to send mail out via this server)<br>
      <br>
      <strong>4. Email List Reply-To E-Mail Address</strong> - This is the (optional)
      reply-to email address that all messages broadcast from this list will
      be &quot;replied to&quot; (meaning if someone's clicks reply in their email application
      to send a reply back to this message the reply will go to this address
      specified here (this does not affect bounce collection as bounced messages
      will still return to their originating (from) address<br>      
      <br>
      <strong>5. Email List SMTP Mail Server</strong> - This is the SMTP (Outgoing
      Mail) Server that the system will use to broadcast your messages. This
      may or may not be the same as the Mail Server you have defined within Coldfusion
      Administrator - if you only have one mail server then this will be the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>6. Email List POP Mail Server</strong> - This is the POP (Incoming
      Mail) Server that the system will use to log in to and retrieve messages
      that have been sent to or in case of bounced messages returned to this
      account on the mail server. <u>In most situations this will be the same
      as the SMTP Server above</u>. This may or may not be the same as the Mail
      Server you have defined within Coldfusion Administrator - if you only have
      one mail server then this will be the same. <br>

      <strong>9. Email List Global Header (optional)</strong> - This is a global
      header (text version) that you may define for use by all messages on this
      list. This will be the first thing displayed at the top of every message

      for those wishing to define a default header layout for all messages).
      Will be used by the text portion of the message<br>
      <br>
      <strong>10. Email List Global Footer (optional)</strong> - This is a global
      footer (text version) that you may define for use by all messages on this
      list. This will be the last thing displayed at the bottom of every message
      broadcast out by the system (The default unsubscribe line of text will
      be displayed below this). (Not Required, simply here as a convenience for
      those wishing to define a default header layout for all messages) . Will
      be used by the text portion of the message<br>
      <br>
      <strong>11. Email List Global Header HTML (optional)</strong> - This is
      a global header (HTML version) that you may define for use by all messages

      <strong>12. Unsubscribe Text Font Face</strong> - At the bottom of every
      message broadcast is a few lines explaining to the subscriber how to unsubscribe
      form the List that they have received this message from. When sending a
      HTML message that you have formatted nicely you may wish to keep this text
      at the base of your message in keeping with the font face used in the rest
      of the message. You can easily define this by selecting a default font
      face here<br>
      <br>
      <strong>13. Unsubscribe Text Font Size</strong> - Extending on from the
      explanation above you can also set the default size of the text in an HTML
      message with this selection.<strong><br>

  the creation of extended tracking capabilities for your HTML email messages.

  email message broadcast, when this feature is enabled the actual email address
  of the subscriber and the number of times that individual subscriber clicked
  the link is also logged. You will see an additional link in the Click Thru
  Stats screen [detail] will be beside the click through count and when clicked
  (if this feature is enabled) will display the email subscribers who have clicked
  this link.<strong> </strong><u><font color="#FF0000">This features is disabled
