*Note during the import process the following operations are performed prior
to the inserting of the subscribers into the database.<br>
- Each email is validated to be in correct format to qualify as a valid email
address (i.e. minimum of 6 chars, contains at least 1 '@', does not contain any
spaces or illegal characters among other tests)<br>
- Each email is also validated to be unique (ensuring the database does not contain
duplicates)
