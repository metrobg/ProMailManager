    <td class="bodyText">The screen is quite simple to use, you have 2 options<br>      <br>
      <strong>1a.</strong> To search for a subset of subscribers based on your
      own criteria, you can enter almost any type of matching criteria for a
      specific field in your subscriber list and choose this field from the pop-up
      menu, you can search by Name, Domain/Email address, City, State, Custom
      fields and more. Once you enter your search criteria and the results (if
      any) are returned the next step is to save this group if you wish to keep
      it by giving it a name and hitting save (a representation of this screen
      is below). Simply type a descriptive name for the search/group of subscribers
      and hit the Save Group button.<br>

  <tr>
    <td class="bodyText"><strong>1a.</strong> If you have already created and
      saved 1 or more groups of subscriber groups you can select the name of
      the group from the pop-up here and perform 1 of 3 functions<br>
      - <strong>Retrieve Group</strong>: this will merely retrieve the subscribers
      that are saved as part for this group<br>
      - <strong>Update Group</strong>: this will re-seed the group members based
      on your original criteria. The way the group save function works is that
      when you initially
      perform a search and save the resultant set of subscribers based on this
      criteria, if new subscribers are added later to your list that match this
      criteria then you must click &quot;Update Group&quot; to add any new subscribers
      that may match the original criteria for this group.<br>
      - <strong>Delete Group</strong>: This will as the name suggests delete
      the saved group and its members (this <strong><font color="Red">DOES NOT delete
      any subscribers from your main list</font></strong>, all groups and group members are store independently of
      your main subscriber list)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="bodyText"><hr size="1" noshade></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="bodyText">Additionally 1 further function is provided on this
      page when you select an existing group name form the group list pop-up
      menu and click the &quot;Retrieve Group&quot; button, this will return the current
      matching subscriber group and allow you to manually remove individual subscribers
      from this group (again this <strong><font color="Red">DOES NOT delete any
      subscribers from your main list</font></strong>). Simply uncheck the box
      beside the subscriber you wish to remove from this group and click the
      update button. The group will be updated with this subscriber removed from
      it.<br>
      <strong>* Note</strong>, after updating your group manually using this
      functionality later using the &quot;Update Group&quot; button will not only update
      the group with new
      matching members but also it will re-add any previously matching subscribers
      you may have manually removed from this group.</td>
