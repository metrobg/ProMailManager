            <br>
      </u><strong><font color="#000099">1. Server Address</font><br>
      </strong>This is the full URL (address) to the root directory of the system
      (<strong>with trailing /</strong>). This URL must be set correctly as it
      is used when a message is processed and click-thru links are created in
      the message. When this is done all links are replaced with a URL that leads
      to the redirect.cfm file in the root level of the system. Therefore you
      should be able to append<strong> redirect.cfm</strong> to the immediate
      end of the url you enter above and you should be able to reach the redirect.cfm
      file in the root folder from anywhere on the internet.<br>
  * Note this should not be an internal address such as 127.0.0.1 or localhost
  as this will cause broken links in your email messages as these addresses are
  not publicly accessible internet addresses<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#000099">2. Local Server Address</font><br>
</strong>This is the full URL (address) to your installation when accessed from
the local server (<strong>with
trailing /</strong>). This URL must be set correctly as it is used when all scheduled
tasks are created on the server. This setting has been added for better support
of running scheduled tasks on server behind firewall's, in such cases the local
server cannot access the web site via a fully qualified url. Examples would be
http://127.0.0.1/maillist/ (this would follow the same format used by CF Administrator)<strong></strong><strong>  <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#000099">3. Are you using Coldfusion MX (6.1)</font><br>
  </strong>Ensure you check this box if you are using MX (6.1), if you are using
  version 4/4.5/5/MX then make sure you uncheck this box and press the &quot;Update&quot; button.
  By default this is checked assuming your version is MX (6.1) <font color="#FF0000">*If
  you are still using MX 6.0 you should upgrade as soon as possible performance
  and cfmail tag are considerably improved</font><br>
    <br>
    <strong><font color="#000099">4. Site Style</font><br>
    </strong>There is a Styles directory at the root level of the main directory
    that stores external style sheets for the system. As they become available
    we will make available new style sheets for download from our web site that
    you can add to this directory and use as an alternate style scheme for the
    site. if you have more than one style sheet in this directory then updating
    the name of the style sheet you wish to use in this box which change which
    style sheet is used throughout the system. (currently this feature is not
    used)</p>

      <p class="bodyText"><font color="#000099"><strong>9 - 11 Custom Field Names</strong></font> -
        You can now setup your own extra &quot;custom fields&quot; in the subscribers table,
        currently 5 custom fields are available, when in the subscribers screen
        you will see these fields listed in the Add New window and also the detail
        pop-up window for updating a subscribers extended information. Here you
        can assign a descriptive name for each field if you plan on utilizing
        them so that they will be easy to remember when you are using them throughout
        your application. Once you assign a name to the custom field here then
        this name will appear throughout the application in place of &quot;Custom
        Field 1/2/3/4/5&quot;. This is a very powerful tool allowing you even
        greater control over storing demographic information on your subscribers.
        These fields can be searched on to create subscriber groups and more.<br>
