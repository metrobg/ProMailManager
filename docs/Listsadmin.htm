    <td class="bodyText"><strong>Subscription List/s [ID]<br>
    </strong>This is where you define the default settings for your List, information
    required on this screen is <a href="listSetup.htm">explained in depth here</a><strong> </strong>The
    [ID] column shows the ID of this list (this number is used when you setup
    subscription forms on your web site and make a call to the subscribeEngine.cfm
    custom tag.<br>
    <strong><br>
Current Messages<br>
</strong>This column displays the number of current messages and a link [ View
] to click to go directly to view these messages<br>
<br><strong>Create New Message<br>
</strong>Clicking the<img src="images/icon-new-message.gif" width="17" height="18"> [New] link will lead to the New Message creation screen
to create a new message for broadcasting to this Subscription List<br>
<br>
<strong>Active Subscribers<br>
</strong>Clicking the <img src="images/icon-users-active.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absbottom"> icon
will take you to the Subscribers administration screen, where you can view/update/remove/add/import
current subscribers to this list. The number beside this icon is the current
number of subscribers currently subscribed to this list<br>
* This column may also have both of the following icons - they have the following
actions associated with them<br>
<img src="../images/deleteIcon_Red.gif" width="12" height="15" align="absbottom">When
your list has bounced subscribers flagged this icon will appear and clicking
it will remove all bounced subscribers regardless of bounce reason.<br>
<img src="../images/deleteIcon_blue.gif" width="12" height="15" align="absbottom">When
your list has bounced subscribers flagged this icon will also appear and it provides
you more selective power in cleaning up your list of these bounced subscribers.
Clicking this icon will open a new window with the ability to selectively delete
subscribers that are flagged as bounced in your list. Once this window is open
full instructions for its use are provided.<br>
<br><strong>Removed Subscribers<br>
</strong>Clicking the <img src="images/icon-users-removed.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absbottom"> icon
will take you to the Removed Subscribers administration screen. When a subscriber
un subscribes form your list they are removed form the active subscribers table
and subsequently from receiving any further messages that are broadcast. As an
added feature these subscribers are still maintained in a removed subscribers
list that you can refer to. The number beside this icon is the current number
of subscribers currently removed from this list<br>
<br><strong>Groups<br>
</strong><img src="images/icon-groups.gif" width="21" height="19" align="absbottom">Clicking
this icon will take you to the new subscriber groups screen, this screen is explained
further here. The subscribers groups provides a new powerful feature enabling
you to create a sub-group or subset of your existing subscription list, essentially
enabling you if you wish to send out a broadcast to a subset of your subscriber
list should you wish instead of being restricted to sending your broadcast to
your entire subscriber list only. Thesis provides you with many powerful options
for use.<br>
<br>
<strong>Get Mail (*PLEASE NOTE THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE TO COMPLETE*)<br>
</strong>Clicking the <img src="images/logo-maillist-sm.gif" width="33" height="21"> icon
will cause the system to log into your Pop mail server with the login details
you have defined in your <a href="listSetup.htm">List Setup screen</a> After
successfully logging into the system will perform a list of sophisticated functions.<br>
These include retrieving all messages on the system and then searching these
message for &quot;<font color="#FF0000">unsubscribe</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color="#FF0000">subscribe</font>&quot; requests.
In addition to this the system will also perform a search on these messages and
determine what messages have bounced back to the system form a previous broadcast
mailing. If a bounced message is found then the subscriber's email address is
purged from the email and matched to the subscriber list for a match, if it is
found to be a current subscriber then this subscriber will be flagged in the
system as have been bounced (message undeliverable). When viewing the subscriber
list it will be signified by the <img src="images/bouncedBomb.gif" width="20" height="17" align="absbottom">icon.
The wonderful work that the system performs does not stop there, it also logs
the date and time of the bounce in a bounce log so if you choose not to remove
the subscriber from the active list on an initial bounce you may quickly view
on subsequent message broadcasts if this same email address bounced again. The
log is maintained and updated each time you click the Get Mail icon. <br>
* It is important to note that a lot of work is going on here to achieve the
above actions and depending on how much mail may be on the Server at the time
you run this function and the resources you have available on the Coldfusion
Server running this application this process may take a while to complete. Do
not close the window until the process has completed. Once completed the mail
is <strong>deleted</strong> from the pop server<br>
